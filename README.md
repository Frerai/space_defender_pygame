Learning pygame module

This is a fully functional game, that'll work within any IDEs.
Downloading and installing "pygame" module is needed.

Please do let me know if you have any comments, or ideas for improvements - I will be adding extra features as I progress.

Thank you for tuning in, and please do have fun playing the game!
